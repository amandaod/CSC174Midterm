# CSC174 Midterm -- Walt Disney World
By Amanda O'Donnell

## Ontology
- Each Disney park has a name
- Each Disney park has an icon based off of a major building in the park
- Each Disney park has some basic introductory information
- Each Disney park has a list of must see attractions

## Taxonomy
The information about each Disney park will have its name listed at the front, and the following headings: Introduction and Must See Attractions.  These are repeated to establish a consistent structure.

## Choreography
The information about each park starts with the name of the park and its icon on the left, then to the right of that is introductary information about the park, and then to the right of that is the list of must see attractions.  I chose this order based on the rank-order importance of those three elements.  The parks are ordered chronologically by opening date from top to bottom on the information page.

## Z-Pattern
I put a logo for the website linking to the home page in the quadrant 1, as users have come to expect this and it sets expectations for the website.  I then put a button to subscribe to the newsletter of the website in quadrant 2, as getting users to subscribe is the secondary goal of the website.  I put a quote from Walt Disney in quadrant 3 as this is supposed to be a week spot, and then put a button to view more information about Walt Disney World in quadrant 4 as getting users to view more information is the primary goal of the website.  I chose an attractive image of all four Disney Parks Icons to fill the space in the middle.

## F-Pattern
I put the names of the Disney parks and their icons in the first column of content making up my F pattern as this content is very easily scannable, and is also the most important.  In the next column of content on each branch of the F pattern I included introductory information about each park, as this is the second most important piece of content.  I left the list of must see attractions for the right-most side of each branch of the F pattern as this list is the least important aspect of each park since most people's must-see lists differ wildly.

## CRAP Principles
### Contrast
In order to contrast the different parks from each other on the information page, I gave them different background colors to match the parks usual map background colors.

### Repetition
I used repetition in the heading names and the formatting of the information about each different park to establish a coherent theme.

### Alignment
I did not use alignment much specifically, aside from ensuring that I was not using the justify style of text that is harder to read.  I also made sure that elements were lined up in a visually appealing way.

### Proximity
I used proximity to group the information about each park together by keeping this information close within a border, and then leaving space between each of these groupings to show that each park is unique.

## Fonts
I chose the font Marck Script for headings and small amounts of large print text because it gives a fanciful, welcoming feel, just like Disney aims for.  (The actual Disney font was not readily available.)  I paired it with the much more legible but still fancy EB Garamond for the paragraphs, bullet points, and other longer chunks of text.

## CSS Architecture Structure
I followed the SMACSS CSS architecture to structure my CSS rules.  This structure is defined in more detail in a comment on the top of the file style.css.

## Other Comments
I'm very pleased with the clear information architecture in my website.  I am proud of how clearly and cleanly my website presents the information, and demonstrates a Z pattern and an F pattern (especially since these concepts were still a bit unclear to me for the last assignment).
